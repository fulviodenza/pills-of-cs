# Intro

Hi! And welcome to the contribution guidelines for pills-of-cs.
Thanks for the interest in contributing!

# How can I contribute?

You can contribute in lot of ways. As always, there are lot of stuff to do here.
So let's start:

- add text pills to assets/pills.json
- implement features following the project board and the issues
- write tests
- write documentation for functions

# I have my change ready, what I do?

Open the PR towards the main branch. If all checks pass, the PR will be reviewed
and eventually approved.
Every PR should contain a description of the feature (if it's a big feature) and
should contain the related issue (each PR should have an issue).
