There are two methods for addressing system growth: **vertical and horizontal scaling. Vertical Scaling: involves increasing the capacity of a single server, such as using a more powerful CPU, adding more RAM, or increasing the storage space. Horizontal Scaling: involves increasing the number of server dividing the system dataset over that servers."
